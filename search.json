Using data from two large surveys and exploiting random variation in sibship size induced by twin births, we identify the causal effect of having an extra sibling on the timing of home-leaving. We find that one additional sibling speeds up the transition to independent living by roughly six months. We provide evidence that our results directly stem from a decrease in the value of intergenerational coresidence implied by having an extra sibling.\n\n\n\nWork in progress\n\nHeterogeneity in the price premia around high performing schools\nwith Ellen Greaves\nPreliminary draft available upon request"
