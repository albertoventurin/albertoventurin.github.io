Exploiting random variation in sibship size induced by twin births, we identify the causal effect of having an extra sibling on the timing of home-leaving. We find that one additional sibling speeds up the transition to independent living by roughly six months and provide evidence that our results stem from a decrease in the value of living with parents. We interpret our results as the combination of a channel that decreases the value of co-residence and a channel that increases the value of early home-leaving.\n\n\n\nWork in progress\n\nRe-examining the property price premia around ‘good’ schools\nwith Ellen Greaves"
