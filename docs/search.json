Exploiting random variation in sibship size induced by twin births, we identify the causal effect of having an extra sibling on the timing of home-leaving. We find that one additional sibling speeds up the transition to independent living by one year. We provide evidence that the main mechanism behind our results is a decrease in the value of inter-generational co- residence, as having an extra sibling entails higher privacy costs associated with living in a more crowded nest. We furthermore document response heterogeneity by groups of countries, with Western European countries displaying the largest responses. Our findings suggest that demographic trends may have attenuated the gap in co-residence rates across different European regions."
