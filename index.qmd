# Welcome !

I am a 3rd-year PhD candidate in Economics at the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence, Italy, under the supervision of [Thomas Crossley](https://sites.google.com/site/tfcrossley/) and [Alessandro Tarozzi](https://sites.google.com/site/alessandrotarozzi/home).

My main research interests are applied microeconomics and causal inference, with a particular focus on family economics, health economics and labor economics.
